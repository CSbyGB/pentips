# Scripts I made for different purposes

## Order urls by code

- The goal of this script is to easily sort urls for when there is a big list of urls. This can happen when you have engagements with a company that has a lot of urls to check out. 
- The script will output 4 files: One with codes 400, one with codes 200 one with code 300 and one with errors such as timeout and other exceptions that might be raised.
- Get the script [here](https://github.com/CSbyGB/order-urls-by-code)
- It can definitely be improved so feel free to contribute.
