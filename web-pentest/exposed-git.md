It can happen during a pentest engagement that you will find a git folder.  

## Get the git folder in your local machine  

### From AWS

Say you found an aws bucket and it contains a git folder in `rootfolder/.git`.  
You will need to take the root folder locally this way you will be able to use git commands such as `git diff`  

### From a web server

`wget -r http://target.com/.git`

## Explore the content

- `git status` see tje status of changes
- `git diff` will show the changes
- `cat .git/refs/heads/master` will give you a reference to the latest commit.  
- `git log -1 master` will show commit message
- `git show -s --pretty=raw b64c8dcfa8a39af06521cf4cb7cdce5f0ca9e526` here `b64c8dcfa8a39af06521cf4cb7cdce5f0ca9e526` is a reference to the commit you got from git log
