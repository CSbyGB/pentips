# OWASP Top 10

- *Note: In this section our example will be taken using OWASP Juice shop which is a voluntarily vulnerable application. You can get it [here](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) along with explainations on how to install and run it on Kali (For the example the install was made using Docker and for challenges not available with docker I used the one from tryhackme [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/owaspjuiceshop))  
We are also going to use examples from [XSS Game](https://xss-game.appspot.com/)*

## SQL Injection

- To find a SQL injection we can try to add special chars in forms and analyze the responses we get.
- In our example when using a special char in the login form we got a very verbose sqlite error that indicates that we have sql injection  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176012290-db39f368-c207-462c-8dcc-94e7568f2a74.png)  
- Using this payload `test' OR 1=1;--` we were able to login because `--` comments the rest of the query so the password is not checked

## Broken authentication

- [OWASP A2-Broken Authentication](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication)
- In our example we have user enumeration
  - When a user exist if we go to forgot password we can get a security question  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176014637-643d1df8-a8e5-4ca2-8fee-ad7fc7054a35.png)
  - If the user does not exist we do not get a security question  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176014820-65e008a7-56d9-400f-ade9-2d1fa75ccd6e.png)
- We also have to see if we can bypass authentication

## Sensitive data exposure

- [OWASP A3-Sensetive Data Exposure](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure)
- Using directory busting we can find sensitive info like folders or backup files
  - In our example there is an ftp page  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176016346-5f3989ee-f4a3-4071-8355-fdb534b843dc.png)  
- We can check the response and grep on keywords like `passwords` or `keys`
- We also need to check if `HSTS` is enabled which means that we need to check if the strict transport security header is used and properly set up. Check [this](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) on OWASP for more info.
- It is also checking SSL we can use [testssl](https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh) for this purpose or nmap with `nmap --script=ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 domain.com`

## XML External Entities (XXE)

- In this XML code we are defining something that works like a constant in a way, everytime we will call the &from; we will put the value "someone".
- However when using this we could mess up with it by adding special chars that would be interpreted as xml
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE gift [
  <!ENTITY from "someone">
]>
<gift>
  <To>someone else</To>
  <From>&from;</From>
  <Item>A nice item</Item>
</gift>
```
- We can try this payload taken from PayloadsAllTheThings(https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/XXE%20Injection/README.md#classic-xxe)
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
  <!DOCTYPE foo [  
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]><foo>&xxe;</foo>
```
- For our example we put this in a file called test.xml
- We will abuse this file upload function  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176021996-7c6f4800-7808-4d64-bb0f-3a77bb130ace.png)  
- We select our xml file to upload it and enter some string in the description field and send this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176022435-0d9bbbee-9213-458f-80f2-eaad66959593.png)  
- It works we are able to get the /etc/passwd file  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176022664-f0efe050-90a0-4f2a-af53-ff76fd326ea9.png)  

## Broken Access Control

- [OWASP A5-Broken Access Control](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control)
- It means that a user gets access to something they should not be able to access
- In our example we are going to use the customer feedback section and leave a feedback as another customer.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176023546-cb4396e4-b743-412d-96f0-826138aabb4a.png)  
- There is a hidden `userID` field on the form that we can see if we check out the source code  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176024183-dfa9068b-2726-4172-8526-bf092dddc635.png)  
- If we make it visible we can see our own user id is 21  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176024421-47718465-3dbb-4c7d-9ccd-7ef93a8e6a1b.png)  
- We can change it to 1 for example  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176024629-2da90820-e14f-4ef4-826f-8d3939c1617d.png)  
- If we submit this we have successfully exploited Broken Access Control by posing feedback as another user  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176024824-fa21c18a-5aae-4fce-b83d-098612ef9419.png)  

## Security Misconfiguration

- [OWASP A6-Security Misconfigurations](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A6-Security_Misconfiguration)
- Default credentials in a login page
- Stack traces

## Cross Site Scripting

- [OWASP A7-Cross Site Scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS))
- [DOM Based XSS](https://www.scip.ch/en/?labs.20171214)
- [XSS Game](https://xss-game.appspot.com/)
- To find an XSS the thing to do is to look for inputs in the website like search bar, comment form, etc.
- Goals: steal cookies, deface website, denial of service, keylogging, ...

### Reflected

- Our XSS is not persistent so our payload is not kept in database
- In our example we stumble on an interesting url that takes an id parameter:  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176029906-a693641f-72f8-4fee-bfd8-5ad05e25fb21.png)  
- We can try to inject our payload `<iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">`  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176030400-bfbd0a17-bc01-4326-be03-9f0d2357cbd7.png)  

### Stored

- Our XSS is persistent so our payload is stored in the database so anyone accessing our page will have the payload executed.
- For this example we are going to use XSS game and this payload `<img src='#' onerror=alert(1) />`  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176032738-483a7691-4db8-473e-9d2d-789f072374ea.png)  
- It works  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176032836-44f5e708-896c-4344-9df3-b4294658c9aa.png)  

### Prevent XSS
