- Usually on port 143, 993

With the help of the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), access to emails from a mail server is possible.  
IMAP allows online management of emails directly on the server and supports folder structures. Thus, it is a network protocol for the online management of emails on a remote server. The protocol is client-server-based and allows synchronization of a local email client with the mailbox on the server, providing a kind of network file system for emails, allowing problem-free synchronization across several independent clients.
