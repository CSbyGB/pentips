# Java notes for Secure Code Review

## Interesting class

### SecureRandom

- [SecureRandom in oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html)
- SecureRandom: Every instance of SecureRandom is created with an initial seed. It works as a base for providing random values and changes every time we generate a new value. 

## Tools

I usually use codium I am not a huge fan of IDE lol  
So if you want smart navigation you can use codium (or visual studio code) along with the extention [Language Support for Java](https://open-vsx.org/extension/redhat/java)  
This way if you ctrl+click on function for example you will get to the function definition.
