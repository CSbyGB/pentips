# Useful tips on VScodium (should work on Visual Studio Code as well)

- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is the Free/Libre Open Source Software Binaries of VS Code
- It's a great tool because you can open code repo and it has lots of extentions.

## Command palette

If you go to `view > Command Palette` this is the place where you will be able to type any command you need to execute. You can also launch it with ctrl+shift+p.

- `theme` this will suggest different themes for the editor
- If you remove `>` and type `?` you will have commands suggested to you

## Keyboards shortcut

- `ctrl+shift+p` Open the command palette
- `Ctrl+P` quickly open files from the current folder you are using
- ``` Ctrl+` ``` Opent the integrated terminal
- `CTRL+/` comment a code block
- `Ctrl+K+U` uncomment a code block

## Integrated terminal

## Vocabulary

- **Intellisense** is the feature that allows you to have code completion. Sometimes it will not come with vscode or codium so you will need an extension

## Add the same share on multiple lines at the same time

- Say you want to add `-` on multiple lines. 
- Select all the lines you want to modify or ctrl+A if you want to do this on the whole document
- Press `SHIFT + ALT + I` 
- Press home to go to the begining of the line make you modification :)

## Misc tips

- If you drag and drop a file from a folder to vscode or codium it will automatically create a copy of the file in the folder you are currently working on.
