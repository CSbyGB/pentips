# BloodHound

## Setup and Install

- Install: `sudo apt install bloodhound`
- Launch neo4j for Setup: `neo4j console`
- Open the link provided by neo4j, connect with default creds: `neo4j:neo4j` 
- Change the password
- From the console launch `bloodhound`
- Connect with the creds you just set up in neo4j
- **Note: Sometimes Bloodhound will not properly process files.  
  To solve this it can be useful to download a previous version.  
  [Here](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/releases/tag/4.1.0) is version 4.1.0 that usually does the trick for me.**

## Grabbing Data to feed Bloodhound

- Download and setup an injector for instance invoke-bloodhound for powershell, we can use [sharphound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/blob/master/Collectors/SharpHound.ps1)
- Put Sharphound in your target machine
- From the cmd of your target run: `powershell -ep bypass`
- Run Sharphound: `. .\SharpHound.ps1`
- Now we can invoke-bloodhound to collect data: `Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -Domain DOMAIN.local -ZipFilename data.zip`
- Copy the zip file in your attacking machine
- Click on upload data and double click on the zip file
- In Analysis we can now click to Find all Domains
- We can also find the shortest path to the domain admins
- We want to find boxes where a domain admin is logged in.
- `xfreerdp /v:IP /u:user /drive:data,/tmp` Transfer data to and from the target host with drive redirection

### Grab Data with Sharphound.exe through a Covenant grunt

- Upload Sharphound.exe with the command `upload` on Covenant
- launch it using `shell sharphound.exe -c all`
- Once it's done we can copy the file name of the generated zip
- And use the Covenant download command
- Once done we can click on the file name it should open a pop up and you will be able to choose where to put the file

## Bloodhound Python

- *Note: slower than the PowerShell and C# ingestors*
- Requirements: impacket toolkit, ldap3, and dnspython
- `pip install bloodhound`
- From a linux box not in the domain
  - Edit /etc/resolv.conf
    ```
    # Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
    #     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
    # 127.0.0.53 is the systemd-resolved stub resolver.
    # run "systemd-resolve --status" to see details about the actual nameservers.

    
    domain domain.local
    domain localdomain
    search localdomain
    nameserver IP-ADR
    ```
- `bloodhound-python -dc domain-controller.domain.local -gc domain-controller.domain.local -d domain.local -c All -u first.last -p password`

## Analyzing data

- Check out Domain Users group and see the rights it has
- Click on the pathfinding button and enter the domain to see if we have any direct paths to Domain Admin for all users
- Run some of the Pre-Built Analytics Queries to find additional interesting information
  - Obtain a list of all Domain Admins
  - Look at the `Find Shortest Paths to Domain Admins` query
  - `Find Principals with DCSync Rights` Find accounts that can perform the DCSync attack, which will be covered in a later module.
  - `Users with Foreign Domain Group Membership` Find users that belong to groups in other domains. This can help mount cross-trust attacks.
  - `Groups with Foreign Domain Group Membership` Find groups that are part of groups in other domains. This can help mount cross-trust attacks.
  - `Map Domain Trusts`	Find all trust relationships with the current domain.
  - `Shortest Paths to Unconstrained Delegation Systems` Find the shortest path to hosts with Unconstrained Delegation.
  - `Shortest Paths from Kerberoastable Users` Show the shortest path to Domain Admins by selecting from all users in a dropdown that can be subjected to a Kerberoasting attack.
  - `Shortest Path from Owned Principals` If we right-click a node and select `Mark user as owned` or `Mark computer as owned`, we can then run this query to see how far we can go from any users/computers that we have marked as "owned". This can be very useful for mounting further attacks.
  - `Shortest Paths to Domain Admins from Owned Principals` Find the shortest path to Domain Admin access from any user or computer marked as "owned".
  - `Shortest Paths to High-Value Targets` This will give us the shortest path to any objects that BloodHound already considers a high-value target. It can also be used to find paths to any objects that we right-click on and select Mark X as High Value.
- Look at GPOs as well. In the Enumerating Group Policy Objects (GPOs) section
- In BloodHound, we can right-click on any edge and click on ? Help in the pop-up menu and receive help on the specific edge with various tabs
  - Info	General overview of the edge and what type of access it grants.
  - Abuse Info	Specific tools/commands/techniques that can be used to abuse the privilege.
  - Opsec Considerations	Opsec Considerations are also documented on the BloodHound wiki. This provides info on how "noisy" a particular command can be and what type of event log ID it will generate.
  - References	Additional reading on tactics/tools/techniques that can be used to abuse the privilege.

## Icons in Bloodhound

- This icon is used to represent a user:  
  ![User Icon](../.res/user-icon.png)
  
- This icon is used to represent a group:  
  ![Group Icon](../.res/Group-Icon.png)
  
- This icon is used to represent a GPO:  
  ![GPO Icon](../.res/GPO-icon.png)  
  we can click on it and check the Node Info

## Cypher Query Language for custom queries

([Source: ACTIVE DIRECTORY BLOODHOUND on HTB Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-bloodhound))

### Structure of query

- `MATCH (A)-[B]->(C) RETURN A,B,C` Here A and C are nodes B is the relationship between A and C
- `MATCH (n:User),(m:Group) MATCH p=(n)-[r:MemberOf*1..3]->(m) RETURN p`

### Most common Keywords

- `MATCH` Used before describing the search pattern for finding one or more nodes or relationships.
- `WHERE` Used to add more constraints to specific patterns or filter out unwanted patterns.
- `RETURN` Used to specify the results format and organizes the resulting data. Results can be returned with specific properties, lists, ordering, etc.
- `CREATE` and `DELETE` - Used to create and delete nodes/relationships
- `SET` and `REMOVE` - Used to set values to properties and add labels to nodes
- `MERGE` - Used to create nodes uniquely without any duplicates.

### Example of query

- `MATCH p=(n:User)-[r:MemberOf*1..]->(m:Group {highvalue:true}) RETURN p` Find the members of all groups deemed to be "high-value targets."
- `MATCH (u:User) WHERE ANY (x IN u.serviceprincipalnames WHERE toUpper(x) CONTAINS 'SQL')RETURN u` Find users with a keyword in their Service Principal Name (SPN)
- `MATCH (u:User {dontreqpreauth: true}) RETURN u` Find users who do not require Kerberos pre-authentication 
- `MATCH (u:User) WHERE u.description IS NOT NULL RETURN u.name,u.description` Find all users with a description field that is not blank

### Edge relationships in Bloodhound

- MemberOf	One node (user, group, or computer) is a member of a second node (group)
- AdminTo	One node (user, group, or computer) has local admin rights on a second node (computer)
- HasSession	One node (user) has a session on a second node (computer)
- TrustedBy	One node (domain) is trusted by a second node (domain)

## Exploiting ACEs

A significant amount of ACEs can be misconfigured, and the exploits for each vary. The Bloodhound documentation assists in explaining enumerated ACEs and how they can be exploited.

- **ForceChangePassword**: We have the ability to set the user's current password without knowing their current password.
- **AddMembers**: We have the ability to add users (including our own account), groups or computers to the target group.
- **GenericAll**: We have complete control over the object, including the ability to change the user's password, register an SPN or add an AD object to the target group.
- **GenericWrite**: We can update any non-protected parameters of our target object. This could allow us to, for example, update the scriptPath parameter, which would cause a script to execute the next time the user logs on.
- **WriteOwner**: We have the ability to update the owner of the target object. We could make ourselves the owner, allowing us to gain additional permissions over the object.
- **WriteDACL**: We have the ability to write new ACEs to the target object's DACL. We could, for example, write an ACE that grants our account full control over the target object.
- **AllExtendedRights**: We have the ability to perform any action associated with extended AD rights against the target object. This includes, for example, the ability to force change a user's password.

In order to exploit these ACEs, we will need a method to interact with AD to make these requests. The two best options for this are the AD-RSAT PowerShell cmdlets or PowerSploit.  
Depending on the breach and the detection tools in the environment, one option may be stealthier.

### Examples

- `AddMembers` To exploit this we just need to add our user to the desired group using powershell `Add-ADGroupMember "IT Support" -Members "barbara.reid"`
- Checked that it worked `Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "IT Support"`
- `ForceChangePassword` Identify a member of the group we want to change the password for taking over their account `Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Tier 2 Admins"`
- And then we can change the password. *Note: It can take up to 10 minutes to be effective. We also might need to disconnect and reconnect*.

```dos
$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString "Newpassword1234!" -AsPlainText -Force 
Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity "t2_melanie.davies" -Reset -NewPassword $Password 
```

## Other Tips Bloodhound

- If we click on a blade in the graph and select help we will have useful info about the specific blade selected. It is really worth having a look at the help and abuse info to have more info and tips on ways of exploitation.
