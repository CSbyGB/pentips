# Attacking Active Directory

*Note: This documentation is mostly made from my notes on [TCM Security Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/)  
It will be complemented with notes from my practice and from other classes like the one from [HTB Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/)*

## Methodology

- Useful tool to install in kali is [pimpmykali](https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali) (choose 0 in option menu)
- First thing to do is launch responder (along with scans to generate traffic)
- LLMNR Poisoning
- SMB Relay Attack
- Look for websites in scope
- Check for default credentials (printers, tomcat, jenkins,...)
- Compromise a machine (as many as possible with lateral movement)
- Enumerate (network) with tools for post-compromise attack
- Get Domain Admin with post-compromise attacks
- Dump with mimikatz
