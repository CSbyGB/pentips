# What to do with a picture

## Reverse Image Searching

- Pretty straightforward we can use this link to do reverse Image searching, you just need to upload the image you are looking for information about
  - [Google Image Search](https://images.google.com)
  - [TinEye](https://tineye.com)  
  - [Yandex](https://yandex.com/)

## Get EXIF Data

Photo have data that is tied to the device and owner of the device

### How to get this data

Using the website Jeffrey's Image Metadata Viewer (see resources) we can extract this information. This contains the device info and geolocalisation.

## Physical Location

- Using the address a customer gave us for a physical pentest mandate, we can enter it in google map and have a look at the sattelite view and street:
  - Does it have any protection
  - Where to park without looking suspicious
  - Is the entree guarded
  - Is there a smoke area (useful for social engineering)
  - Could you tailgate your way in?

## Identifying Geographical Locations

Let's say we have an image
- If there is a car: 
  - where is it parked, 
  - what brand is it, 
  - What info get we get from the license plate, 
- How is the weather
  - Is it snowing?
- Architecture around 
- Street signs
