 # Write an OSINT report

- It has to be very detailed so that the person you will hand the report will be able to reproduce what you did.

## Summary

- We remind here the goals and who mandate us to do what


## Key findinds

- We can sum up here some key high level findings found during the assement (usernames, phone numbers etc.)

## Technical evidence

- Step by step what has been done to find something
- Each technical evidence can be a step.
- We can make it look like a table like this:  

|OSINT| Osint Action done for example username found on websites|
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------|
|Link| link or reference to the used technology|
|notes|explanations and details|

- Then we can add a visual evidence
