# Sock Puppets

## What is it?

- Alternate Identity = use this for osint so that we do not draw attention to ourselves.
- Accounts on social media that looks legitimate (have some posts and data etc) that should not tie back to us

## Creating sock puppets

- Good to knoe: Sock hunters are people who can identify sock puppets
- Step One: Generate a fake name & identity (see fake name generator in resources)
- Step 2: Create a picture for it using an AI generated photo (see thisperson does not exist in resources)
- Step 3: type this person with accounts that does not tie back to you (specific computer for your investigations, burner phone,...)
  - You can create a virtual credit card with privacy.com website (see link in resources) this way you can buy a burner phone or anything using it
  - You can use mint mobile sim card for the burner phone
- Do not do the investigation on your own IP address
