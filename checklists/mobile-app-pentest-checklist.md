# Mobile App Pentest Checklist
 
I was about to make a specific checklist but once again the best one is the one provided by the OWASP foundation.  
You can find it here and the best thing is that each item is clickable and brings you to guidance on how to test the specific item.  
You can download it on locally as a table or browse through it on the website.
