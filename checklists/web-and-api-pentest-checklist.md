# Web and API pentest Checklist

> Made using The OWASP Testing guide (page 211) and the API Security Top 10 2023. You can refer to it (see resources below) for detailed explainations on how to test.  
> Adapt it to your methodology and the context of your test.  
> Download this file locally from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSbyGB/pentips/main/checklists/web-and-api-pentest-checklist.md) this way you can check everything you have done.  
> If you need some practice for specific vulnerabilities to reproduce them in your context, I recommend [portswigger's web security Academy here](https://portswigger.net/web-security).  
> For more explainations on specific topics, if OWASP is not enough you can also use [Portswigger here](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-topics)
