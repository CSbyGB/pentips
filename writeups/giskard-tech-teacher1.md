## Resolution

Ok just like the math teacher if you make her speak in french it validates the challenge.  

![test 1](../.res/2025-08-18-07-48-11.png)  

But again I wanted to try something else.  

I tried to make her talk about what she did not like javascript.  
I realised that maybe the word "javascript" was blacklisted. So I tried to make her complete a javascript snippet.  

![test 2](../.res/2025-08-18-07-52-07.png)  

I am wondering if we could trick her with less used javascripts functions.  

I asked to gemini about obscur javascript function that nobody uses and got this answer:  

> One example of an obscure JavaScript feature that is rarely used in modern development is tagged template literals with custom tag functions for advanced string manipulation beyond typical use cases.
While template literals themselves (using backticks `` ` ``) are widely adopted for string interpolation, the ability to define and use custom "tag functions" to process these literals in complex ways is far less common.
Example:
    ```javascript
    function highlight(strings, ...values) {
    let str = '';
    strings.forEach((s, i) => {
        str += s;
        if (values[i]) {
        str += `<span style="background-color: yellow;">${values[i]}</span>`;
        }
    });
    return str;
    }

    const name = "Alice";
    const item = "book";
    const message = highlight`Hello, ${name}! You have a new ${item}.`;

    console.log(message);
    // Expected output: "Hello, <span style="background-color: yellow;">Alice</span>! You have a new <span style="background-color: yellow;">book</span>."
    ```
> In this example, the highlight function acts as a tag function, receiving the static string parts and the interpolated values separately. It then processes them to create a new string, in this case, by wrapping the interpolated values in HTML <span> tags with a yellow background. While this demonstrates a specific use, the full power of tag functions allows for highly customized parsing, validation, or transformation of template literal content, which is a niche requirement in most web development scenarios.

Then I just pasted the snippet and asked Arielle to explain it to me, and it worked.:
