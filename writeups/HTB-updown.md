## Port 80

- When we go to `http://10.10.11.177/` we land here  

![Landing](../.res/2023-01-05-15-19-38.png)  

- Seems like we'll have some fun ^^

- Let's add this in /etc/hosts first `10.10.11.177 siteisup.htb`

```

- Let's also try to dir bust the subdomain dev. So not possible because of the status code

### Look around

- Ok now let's do what I was tempted to do since I saw the landig page
- `python3 -m http.server 80`
- In the browser let's try to see if we can interact this way and enter `http://10.10.14.10/test` in the form
- And it works our server get an interaction from the target  
![request sent](../.res/2023-01-05-15-28-27.png)  
- Ok what happens if we request for something that exist like if I just ask for `http://10.10.14.10/` or `http://127.0.0.1:80/`  
![up](../.res/2023-01-05-15-34-36.png)  
- So we should try to get files or inject command or see what open port we have using this technique
- We can fuzz for open ports with burp intruder
- We send our request to the intruder we postiton our payload in the port number like this  
![port](../.res/2023-01-05-15-40-07.png)  
- In the payloads tab we choose number. And start from 1 to 65535 with a step of 1.  

![numbers](../.res/2023-01-05-15-43-36.png)  
> If you do not have the pro version of burp the best way would be to use another tool because community version might be slow for this.

- Let's grep `is up.` so in options grep match we delete the table and add our string
![grep](../.res/2023-01-05-15-42-01.png)  
- Let's see our results. So it was worth trying but besides port 80 we do not have anything

- Let's check the git folder we found  
![git](../.res/2023-01-05-16-12-01.png)
- [This article on Hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/git) is interesting to see how we could process with this
- `wget -r http://siteisup.htb/dev/.git/`
- then we can use `git diff` go in the dev directory and run `git diff > diff.txt` this way you can look and grep and really analyze the file
- It is worth having a look at the git [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/) to see useful git commands
- Other interesting commands are the  `git log` we will have the commit history and `git show <commit-id>` to have more info on a specific commit
- This commit is really interesting

    Update .htaccess
    
    New technique in header to protect our dev vhost.

- With this commit we know that in order to access the .htpasswd we need this header in the request `Special-Dev: only4dev` and our Ip should be 127.0.0.1. We alse need a valid pair of credentials
- This one is also interesting

- Let's try to add the new header everywhere and see what we get
- To do so in [burpsuite](https://talkerinfo.com/add-custom-header-in-all-burp-requests/) this article is really helpful
- So here is what it looks like in my Burp  

![burp](../.res/2023-01-06-14-13-21.png)  

- So let's try to navigate to `http://dev.siteisup.htb/`
- We have access to a new page, with a file upload functionality  

![file upload](../.res/2023-01-06-14-17-50.png)  

- The admin panel link and the changelog do not give anything
- I tried a php file and it is doing some checks.
- Maybe there is a way to have a look at the code using the git we found. This way we can see how to bypass this restriction.
- Ok let's try the tool git dumper mentioned in hacktricks
  - `python3 -m venv git-dumper` I prefer to install it in a venv so that I do not mess up my local python
  - `source git-dumper/bin/activate` we activate the env
  - `pip install git-dumper` we install in in the env
  - `git-dumper http://siteisup.htb/dev/.git/ dumpedsite`
  - So now we can see some php file. the index is not where the extension is verified but the checker seems interesting.  
  This function is the one that is of interest for us

```php
if($_POST['check']){
  
 # File size must be less than 10kb.
 if ($_FILES['file']['size'] > 10000) {
        die("File too large!");
  }
 $file = $_FILES['file']['name'];

 # Check if extension is allowed.
 $ext = getExtension($file);
 if(preg_match("/php|php[0-9]|html|py|pl|phtml|zip|rar|gz|gzip|tar/i",$ext)){
  die("Extension not allowed!");
 }

 # Create directory to upload our file.
 $dir = "uploads/".md5(time())."/";
 if(!is_dir($dir)){
    mkdir($dir, 0770, true);
 }
  
  # Upload the file.
 $final_path = $dir.$file;
 move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], "{$final_path}");
 
  # Read the uploaded file.
 $websites = explode("\n",file_get_contents($final_path));
 
 foreach($websites as $site){
  $site=trim($site);
  if(!preg_match("#file://#i",$site) && !preg_match("#data://#i",$site) && !preg_match("#ftp://#i",$site)){
   $check=isitup($site);
   if($check){
   echo "<center>{$site}<br><font color='green'>is up ^_^</font></center>";
   }else{
    echo "<center>{$site}<br><font color='red'>seems to be down :(</font></center>";
   }
  }else{
  echo "<center><font color='red'>Hacking attempt was detected !</font></center>";
  }
 }

  # Delete the uploaded file.
 @unlink($final_path);
}
```

- Very convenient once our file is uploaded we will even know where to fetch it (`http://dev.siteisup.htb/uploads/`). However it will also delete the file so we have to be quick.
- `php|php[0-9]|html|py|pl|phtml|zip|rar|gz|gzip|tar/i` here are the file not allowed. [This article on hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-upload) has nice information on how to bypass these protections
- It mentions phtm which is not in the list. Let's try it. We can upload it.
- The best way I can think of to gain time is to put a big url list in the file and add our payload at the end of this list
- Also be careful to put too many url at the begining because the file limit is 10kb
- phtm does not get interpreted let's try another one in hacktricks there is also .phar. Let's try it
- It seems like what is failing me is not the extention but the php file I am using.
- Let's try another php shell. We get a shell as www-data  

![shell](../.res/2023-03-26-14-11-59.png)  

## Becoming developer

- We need to move to the user developer (we know the user is called developer with `ls /home`) because we can not read the user flag now.  
- Let's upgrade the shell first `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
- Here is the full process

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
// Background our nc / rlwrap nc connection
Ctrl - z 
// Enable standard terminal commands
stty raw -echo;fg
//Reset the shell so we can configure it with our current settings
reset
//Enter the terminal info we noted earlier
Terminal type?
xterm-256color
stty rows 39 columns 190
```

- In the developer home we can not cat the user we do have access to the python file that processes the websites to see if they are up  

![dev](../.res/2023-03-26-14-34-59.png)  

- If we make a file on siteisup here is what we have

```bash
file siteisup
siteisup: setuid ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=b5bbc1de286529f5291b48db8202eefbafc92c1f, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not strippe
```

- It has the suid bit set. If we launch it we have a prompt to put an url  

![](../.res/2023-03-26-14-39-26.png)  

- This is launch as the user developer so this how we could move to this user. We could try to inject code and get files. When enumering the home of developer there was an ssh folder that we had a permission denied on. We could try to get an ssh key from here. [This article](https://janakiev.com/blog/python-shell-commands/) explains how to execute os commands in python.
- Let's try this `__import__('os').system('cat /home/developer/.ssh/id_rsa')` id_rsa is the default name for a private ssh key let's hope it will work in our case.
- We get the private key!!  

![private key](../.res/2023-03-26-14-44-17.png)  

- So now we just need to copy it and paste it in our machine, then we will just have to change the rights and ssh -i as developer. Let's try this!  
- It works  

![developer](../.res/2023-03-26-14-48-22.png)  

- We can grab the user flag

## Privesc

- First thing I usually do in linux when I have a user is `sudo -l` and here we get this interesting output:  

![easy install](../.res/2023-03-26-14-52-20.png)  

- With some research we find out that easy_install is deprecated. And we can find it on the one and only [GTFOBINS](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/easy_install/)

- Let's try this
- `TF=$(mktemp -d)`
- `echo "import os; os.execl('/bin/sh', 'sh', '-c', 'sh <$(tty) >$(tty) 2>$(tty)')" > $TF/setup.py`
- `sudo easy_install $TF`
- It works

![root](../.res/2023-03-26-14-56-55.png)  

- We can get the root flag!
