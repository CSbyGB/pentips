## Port 80

We land here  
![landing page](../.res/2023-07-12-16-25-00.png)

When browsing around we can see that directory listing is enabled.  
We find file users.bak  

![users backup](../.res/2023-07-12-16-27-20.png)  

Here is the content of the file  

![admin](../.res/2023-07-12-16-28-26.png)  

If we enter the md5 hash in crackstation we find the password  

![crackstation](../.res/2023-07-12-16-29-53.png)  

So we have the following credentials `admin:bulldog19`

## Port 8765

We find the admin panel.  
![admin panel](../.res/2023-07-12-16-33-03.png)  
Let's try the credentials we found in the website  
We are logged in  
![admin](../.res/2023-07-12-16-34-01.png)  

If we inspect the request it seems to take an xml parameter  

```http
POST /home.php HTTP/1.1

xml=test
```

When we see xml we need to try XXE attacks.  
Also this snippet of code seems will prompt us for xml code  

```javascript
   <script type="text/javascript">
      //document.cookie = "Example=/auth/dontforget.bak"; 
      function checktarea() {
      let tbox = document.getElementById("box").value;
      if (tbox == null || tbox.length == 0) {
        alert("Insert XML Code!")
      }
  }
</script>
```

There's also a big hint in a comment in the page `<!-- Barry, you can now SSH in using your key!-->`  

This means if our xxe works we could try to find Barry's key

We can check the example `/auth/dontforget.bak`  

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

  <com>his paragraph was a waste of time and space. If you had not read this and I had not typed this you and I could’ve done something more productive than reading this mindlessly and carelessly as if you did not have anything else to do in life. Life is so precious because it is short and you are being so careless that you do not realize it until now since this void paragraph mentions that you are doing something so mindless, so stupid, so careless that you realize that you are not using your time wisely. You could’ve been playing with your dog, or eating your cat, but no. You want to read this barren paragraph and expect something marvelous and terrific at the end. But since you still do not realize that you are wasting precious time, you still continue to read the null paragraph. If you had not noticed, you have wasted an estimated time of 20 seconds.</com>

It's perfect for us we can use this for our attack  
After putting this in the text box we can see that it is sent url encoded in the parameter  

![xml](../.res/2023-07-12-17-29-16.png)  

Let's send this to repeater and play around with it  
We can modify the paylaod in the inspector like this  

![modify request with inspector](../.res/2023-07-12-17-30-41.png)  

This way we get the passwd file  
We indeed see a user Barry let's try and fetch his key  
And it works!  

![Barry's ssh key](../.res/2023-07-12-17-32-44.png)  

Let's try to connect on the server with it. It prompts for a password.  
Let's try to crack it with john the ripper.  

- `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/bleeding-jumbo/run/ssh2john.py`
- `python ssh2john.py barry-key > barry.hash`
- `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt barry.hash `  

![ssh key pass cracked](../.res/2023-07-12-17-43-25.png)  

Here is the password `urieljames`  
And it works  
![barry](../.res/2023-07-12-17-44-37.png)  

And we get the user flag.
