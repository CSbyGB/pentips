- **QUESTION: Interesting, let's see if there's anything else on this web server by fuzzing it. What hidden directory do we discover? ** `/retro`

- We have a `/retro` page, let's have a look  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/163584609-ed1bb0ea-a6a9-409a-8c1f-19e787abbbcd.png)  

- This is obviously a Wordpress, by looking around we know we have a username `Wade`

- No other usernames are found. Let's try to bruteforce login
- **QUESTION: Navigate to our discovered hidden directory, what potential username do we discover?** `wade`
- Method 1: bruteforce with cewl
    - Let's generate a list of pass using cewl `cewl http://10.10.133.249/retro/ > pass.txt`
    - Let's bruteforce with wpscan `wpscan --url http://10.10.133.249/retro --passwords Documents/tryhackme/blaster/pass.txt --usernames wade`
```
[!] Valid Combinations Found:
 | Username: wade, Password: parzival
```

- Method 2: having a look at the comments
  - We find a note wade left to himselg `Leaving myself a note here just in case I forget how to spell it: parzival`
- Connect to wordpress we can now go to the wordpress and login using the found password `wade:parzival` **[OPTIONAL BUT FUN :D]** 
- **QUESTION Crawling through the posts, it seems like our user has had some difficulties logging in recently. What possible password do we discover?** `parzival`

### RDP

- Let's try to connect to rdp with the same credentials `xfreerdp /u:wade /v:10.10.191.161 /p:parzival`
- It works!

- **Log into the machine via Microsoft Remote Desktop (MSRDP) and read user.txt. What are it's contents?** - I let you find this one on your own :D 

## Privesc

- **When enumerating a machine, it's often useful to look at what the user was last doing. Look around the machine and see if you can find the CVE which was researched on this server. What CVE was it?** `cve-2019-1388`
- **Looks like an executable file is necessary for exploitation of this vulnerability and the user didn't really clean up very well after testing it. What is the name of this executable?** `hhupd`
- [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BQKpPNlTSo&ab_channel=ZeroDayInitiative) is the video that shows how to use this exploit for privesc
- **Now that we've spawned a terminal, let's go ahead and run the command 'whoami'. What is the output of running this?** `nt authority\system`
```
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]
(c) 2016 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
C:\Windows\System32>whoami
nt authority\system
C:\Windows\System32>type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
[STRIPPED]
```
- **Now that we've confirmed that we have an elevated prompt, read the contents of root.txt on the Administrator's desktop. What are the contents? Keep your terminal up after exploitation so we can use it in task four!** - I let you answer this question on your own :)

## Persistence

- Follow up the questions on THM and work accordingly
- **Last but certainly not least, let's look at persistence mechanisms via Metasploit. What command can we run in our meterpreter console to setup persistence which automatically starts when the system boots? Don't include anything beyond the base command and the option for boot startup. ** `run persistence -X`
