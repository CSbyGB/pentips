# Proof of Concept

The Proof-Of-Concept (POC) is merely proof that a vulnerability found exists. As soon as the administrators receive our report, they will try to confirm the vulnerabilities found by reproducing them. After all, no administrator will change business-critical processes without confirming the existence of a given vulnerability. A large network may have many interoperating systems and dependencies that must be checked after making a change, which can take a considerable amount of time and money. Just because a pentester found a given flaw, it doesn't mean that the organization can easily remediate it by just changing one system, as this could negatively affect the business. Administrators must carefully test fixes to ensure no other system is negatively impacted when a change is introduced. PoCs are sent along with the documentation as part of a high-quality penetration test, allowing administrators to use them to confirm the issues themselves.  

In this stage, we document, step-by-step, the steps we took to achieve network compromise or some level of access. Our goal is to paint a picture of how we were able to chain together multiple weaknesses to reach our goal so they can see a clear picture of how each vulnerability fits in and help prioritize their remediation efforts. If we don't document our steps well, it's hard for the client to understand what we were able to do and, thus, makes their remediation efforts more difficult. If feasible, we could create one or more scripts to automate the steps we took to assist our client in reproducing our findings.

## Next step

- Post-Engagement: At this point, we can only go to the post-engagement stage, where we optimize and improve the documentation and send it to the customer after an intensive review.
